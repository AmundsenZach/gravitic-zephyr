# gravitic-zephyr
The "Gravitic Zephyr" project is an arcade-style spaceflight simulation game inspired by orbital mechanics. Navigate your spacecraft through planetary systems and experience the challenges of realistic orbital dynamics.

### FEATURES:
  * Real-time orbital simulation with interactive controls.
  * Dynamic guide arcs for preciese trajectory planning.
  * Expansive space environment with multiple planetary bodies (more to come!).

## INSTALLATION / PLAYING THE GAME:

### Option 1: Clone the Repository
  * Clone the repository to your local machine:
      `git clone https://github.com/LegendOfLinky/gravitic-zephyr.git`
  * Open the projects folder and run `index.html` in your web browser.

### Option 2: Play on GitHub Pages
  * You can play Gravitic Zephyr directly in your browser without downloading or setting up anything!
  * Open this link to the GitHub Pages-hosted version:
      https://legendoflinky.github.io/gravitic-zephyr/
  * The game will load in your browser. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to begin playing.
  * If you encounter any issues, ensure your browser supports HTML5 and JavaScript, or try refreshing the page.

## CONTRIBUTING:

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or suggesting ideas, your help is appreciated. Here's how you can contribute:
  * Check out our open issues or create a new one to discuss your ideas.
  * Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature.
  * Make your changes and submit a pull request.
  * Join the discussion in existing issues and pull requests.
    
No contribution is too small - we value all forms of help, from code improvements to typo fixes!

## INSPIRATION:
  * Kerbal Space Program: For its focus on realistic yet approachable orbital mechanics and space exploration gameplay.
  * Lunar Lander: The classic arcade game that emphasized precision and control during space landings.
  * Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous by Buzz Aldrin: The fundamental principle of this PHD thesis still underpins modern orbital mechanics.

## IMPROVEMENT PATH:
  * Add additional planetary bodies.
  * Improve visual design of the ship.
  * Add a planet-centric spacecraft guide arc to compliment the spacecraft-centric one.
  * Add the ability to land on planetary bodies.
  * Add "auto-reset" zone when the spacecraft is a specific distance outside any sphere of influence.
