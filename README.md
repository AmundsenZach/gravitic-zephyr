# gravitic-zephyr
The "Gravitic Zephyr" project is an arcade-style spaceflight simulation game inspired by orbital mechanics. Navigate your spacecraft through planetary systems and experience the challenges of realistic orbital dynamics.

FEATURES:
  * Real-time orbital simulation with interactive controls.
  * Dynamic guide arcs for preciese trajectory planning.
  * Expansive space environment with multiple planetary bodies (more to come!).

INSTALLATION / PLAYING THE GAME:

Option 1: Clone the Repository
  * Clone the repository to your local machine:
      `git clone https://github.com/LegendOfLinky/gravitic-zephyr.git`
  * Open the projects folder and run index.html in your web browser.

Option 2: Play on GitHub Pages
  * You can play Gravitic Zephyr directly in your browser without downloading or setting up anything!
  * Open this link to the GitHub Pages-hosted version:
      https://legendoflinky.github.io/gravitic-zephyr/
  * The game will load in your browser. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to begin playing.
  * If you encounter any issues, ensure your browser supports HTML5 and JavaScript, or try refreshing the page.

INSPERATION
  * Kerbal Space Program: For its focus on realistic yet approachable orbital mechanics and space exploration gameplay.
  * Lunar Lander: The classic arcade game that emphasized precision and control during space landings.
  * Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous by Buzz Aldrin: The fundamental principle of this PHD thesis still underpins modern orbital mechanics.

KNOWN ISSUES:
  * The spacecraft guide arc turns the color of the nearest planetary body when outside any sphere of influence; it should default to white.
  * After a collision, the spacecraft remains stationary instead of synchronizing with the orbit of the planetary body.
  * Time-warp creates instabilities with the orbital guide arc. 

IMPROVEMENT PATH:
  * Add additional planetary bodies.
  * Improve visual design of the ship.
  * Add a planet-centric spacecraft guide arc to compliment the spacecraft-centric one.
  * Add the ability to land on planetary bodies.
  * Add "auto-reset" zone when the spacecraft is a specific distance outside any sphere of influence.
