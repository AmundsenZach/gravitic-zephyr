Will be documentation of trials, tests, and approaches

STEPS;
1 (DONE). Get game-loop and background functioning
2. Create a single base (stationary) planet
3. Work at implimenting the SOI system, based on planet mass
4. Add a moon, with a high eccentricity
5. Impliment the 200% SOI crossover region, scaling with distance
6. Work on implimenting Verlet physics for the spacecraft

TESTS:
1. The mouse acts as a spacecraft, returns the SOI it's currently in; must work with multiple layers

NOTES:
1. Planets will be procedural, but for now planets will be manually created in "celestialConfig.js"
